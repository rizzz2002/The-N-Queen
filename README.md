# The-N-Queen

N-Queens Problem Solver in Python
Welcome to the N-Queens Problem Solver in Python! This project provides a solution for the classic N-Queens problem using a brute force backtracking approach.


Description:

The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. This Python script allows users to input the size of the chessboard and attempts to solve the N-Queens problem by placing queens without violating the rules.


How to Use:

Run the n_queens_solver.py script using Python.
Enter the size of the chessboard when prompted. This will create an NxN chessboard.
Enter a number corresponding to the position on the chessboard to place a queen.
The script will check if the placement is valid according to the rules of the N-Queens problem.
Continue placing queens until either all queens are successfully placed (you win) or an invalid move is made (you lose).


Instructions:

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system to run the script.
The size of the chessboard can be adjusted by entering different values.
Try to solve the N-Queens problem by strategically placing queens without threatening each other.
If you succeed in placing all queens without violating the rules, you win!


Enjoy solving the N-Queens problem and testing your strategic thinking skills!
