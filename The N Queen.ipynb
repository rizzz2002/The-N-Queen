      "How To Play:\n",
      "1) When prompted, enter an integer to set the size of the board (e.g., entering 4 creates a 4x4 board).\n",
      "2) On your turn, input the number corresponding to the cell where you want to place a queen.The board will update and display the current state after each move.\n",
      "3) A queen can be placed in a cell only if it does not share the same row, column, or diagonal with any other queen already on the board.If the chosen cell is invalid (i.e., the queen can be attacked by another queen from the same row, column, or diagonal), the game will notify you, and you will lose the game.\n",
      "4) You win if you successfully place queens on the board such that each queen is not attacking any other queen and you fill the board with queens.The game will notify you when you have won.\n",
